I'm a research scientist and economist. I study how technology changes labor markets and what drives economic integration.

I use quasi-experimental methods – difference-in-differences, event studies, panel data – to answer causal questions with large administrative datasets. My toolkit is R, Python, SQL, and whatever gets the job done.

Recent work includes research on how gig platforms affect labor market integration of refugees, research on compensating wage differentials and health outcomes, and building automated analytics at SHARE NOW (a carsharing company), where I created Tableau dashboards and integrated Salesforce APIs to automate marketing reporting.

I care about research that leads to actual decisions, especially on labor markets, technology, and policy.

Currently finishing my PhD and exploring what's next. Based in Berlin.

Let's connect if you're working on problems where you need to understand causality, not just correlations.
